- Got to db folder in JDK
- To start the network service - the derby server - so that different clients can connect to the same goto bin/ subfolder and run:
  - startNetworkServer -noSecurityManager --> without the noSecurityManager, a basic security manager is installed and an access denied exception occurs while connecting to port 1527

TO run commands - from the db folder
- Run: 
  - ij
  - CONNECT 'jdbc:derby:dee_testing_db;create=true'; --> This creates the dee_testing_db (folder is also created on FS) if not present else connects to it
  - Run SQL create and insert commands as required
