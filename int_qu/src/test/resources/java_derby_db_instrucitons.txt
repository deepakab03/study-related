- Got to db folder in JDK
- To start the network service - the derby server - so that different clients can connect to the same goto bin/ subfolder and run:
  - startNetworkServer -noSecurityManager --> without the noSecurityManager, a basic security manager is installed and an access denied exception occurs while connecting to port 1527

TO run commands - from the db folder
- Run: 
  - ij
  - Use either
     - To connect to an instance of network server assuming dee_testing_db doesn't exist: CONNECT 'jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/dee_testing_db;';
       - Assuming the db doesn't exist and you want to create it if it doesn't use: CONNECT 'jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/dee_testing_db;create=true';
     - To connect to the dee_testing_db ( (assuming dee_testing_db database folder exists or it will create it if not present in current folder) : 
       - CONNECT 'jdbc:derby:dee_testing_db;create=true';
  
  - Run SQL create and insert commands as required
  
To connect to this from java
 - Include the derbyclient maven dependency, spring-jdbc
 - Create datasource with
   - Driver class: org.apache.derby.jdbc.ClientDriver 
   - URL eg: jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/dee_testing_db;create=true
   - No need for username or pwd
 - Inject dataSrouce into a namedParamterJdbcTemplate and use above to run JDBC operations
