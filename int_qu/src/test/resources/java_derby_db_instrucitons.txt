- Got to db folder in JDK
- To start the network service - the derby server - so that different clients can connect to the same goto bin/ subfolder and run:
  - startNetworkServer -noSecurityManager --> without the noSecurityManager, a basic security manager is installed and an access denied exception occurs while connecting to port 1527

TO run commands - from the db folder
- Run: 
  - ij
  - CONNECT 'jdbc:derby:dee_testing_db;create=true'; --> This creates the dee_testing_db (folder is also created on FS) if not present else connects to it
  - Run SQL create and insert commands as required
  
To connect to this from java
 - Include the derbyclient maven dependency, spring-jdbc
 - Create datasource with
   - Driver class: org.apache.derby.jdbc.ClientDriver 
   - URL eg:: jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/dee_testing_db;create=true
   - No need for username or pwd
 - Inject dataSrouce into a namedParamterJdbcTemplate and use above to run JDBC operations
